# Enterprise Solutions QA Project - SQL Validation

1. Verify department synchronization:
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department, last_sync_time FROM sync_table ORDER BY last_sync_time DESC;
```

2. Check data consistency between web and mobile clients:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_data_web WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM user_data_mobile);
```

3. Ensure scheduled reports are generated successfully:
```sql
SELECT report_name, status FROM reports WHERE status = 'completed';
```

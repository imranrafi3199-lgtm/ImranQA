# Banking App QA Project - SQL Validation

1. Verify user transaction accuracy:
```sql
SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) as total_transferred
FROM transactions
WHERE user_id = '12345' AND status = 'SUCCESS';
```

2. Check for failed transactions:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions WHERE status = 'FAILED';
```

3. Validate last login timestamp update:
```sql
SELECT user_id, last_login FROM users WHERE user_id = '12345';
```
